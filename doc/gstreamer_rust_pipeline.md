# creating a basic pipeline in Rust

The goal of this exercise is to create an RTSP server (in Rust/Gstreamer) capable
of take video from a camera or file source, encoding it and streaming it over RTSP. 

We decided to start with a prototype consisting of a simple gstreamer pipeline 
written in Rust. You can find the details [here](../prototype/README.md)

**Idea**

All the examples I have found out there invove gst-launch building pipelines on 
the command line. However, I haven't found code example (And I believe that the 
gstreamer examples are very genric)

I did find what appears to be a Rust Example in the [gstreamer-rs]https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs/blob/master/examples/src/bin/rtsp-server.rs) project

Another avenue is Amazon Kinesis

However [Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/examples-gstreamer-plugin.html) has an example of such pipeline (written in C++) on gitHub calle [Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Procedure SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp). This project contains
the plugin implementation but this [sample code](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/blob/master/samples/kvs_gstreamer_multistream_sample.cpp) seems to have what appears to 
be an RTSP pipeline.
